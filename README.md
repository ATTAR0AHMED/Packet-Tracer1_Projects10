# README

Welcome to the Packet Tracer project covering LAN, WAN, WLAN, MAN, TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, IPv4, IPv6, DHCP, and DNS!

## Description

This extensive Packet Tracer project provides a comprehensive simulation environment for exploring various networking concepts and protocols. It covers Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), as well as key networking protocols including TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, IPv4, IPv6, DHCP, and DNS. 

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Cisco website [here](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).

Once Packet Tracer is installed:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Packet Tracer.
3. Import the `.pkt` files included in the project.
4. Explore the different network scenarios and configurations provided in the project.

## Usage

This Packet Tracer project offers a wide range of functionalities:

- **Explore Diverse Network Types**: Dive into LANs, WANs, WLANs, and MANs to understand their architectures, topologies, and characteristics.
- **Study Networking Protocols**: Analyze the functionalities and behaviors of TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, IPv4, IPv6, DHCP, and DNS through practical simulations.
- **Configure Network Devices**: Experiment with configuring routers, switches, PCs, servers, and other network devices to establish communication and services.
- **Test Connectivity and Performance**: Verify connectivity between devices, analyze network traffic, and troubleshoot connectivity issues.
- **Implement DHCP and DNS Services**: Configure DHCP servers to dynamically assign IP addresses and DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- **Analyze and Monitor Networks**: Use packet capture tools to analyze network traffic, monitor performance, and identify network anomalies.
